**TITLE: SUPPORT DOC**

**Overview**

This release introduces the initial setup and synchronization of product data for the Intelligent Search AI Shopify app. This involves importing your product information from your Shopify store to our system. This is a one-time process that will enable the AI-powered search features.

**What's New?**

*   **Initial Product Sync:** The app will now automatically begin synchronizing your Shopify product catalog to our system. This happens in the background, so you shouldn't experience any disruption to your store.

**Impact on Users**

*   For the average Shopify store owner: After installing the app, the product data will automatically begin synchronizing in the background.

**FAQ**

*   **Q: How long does the initial sync take?**
    *   A: The initial sync time depends on the size of your product catalog. Smaller stores will sync in a matter of minutes, while larger stores may take longer. The app will display a status message to inform you of the progress.
*   **Q: Do I need to do anything to start the sync?**
    *   A: No, the sync process starts automatically after the app is installed.
*   **Q: What if I add new products to my store?**
    *   A: Automatic updates using webhooks for product data will be coming in a future release to ensure the most up-to-date data in the backend.
*   **Q: Will the app slow down my Shopify store?**
    *   A: No, the sync process runs in the background and is designed to minimize any impact on your store's performance.
*   **Q: What data is being synced?**
    *   A: The app syncs product titles, descriptions, images, pricing, and other relevant information to enable the AI-powered search features.
*   **Q: I still see old/incorrect data. How can I retrigger the import?**
    *   A: If the product data is not being synced properly, please contact our support team.

**TITLE: DEV DOC**

**Overview**

This document provides insights into the implementation of the initial product data synchronization feature. It highlights key design decisions and potential areas of complexity.

**Key Implementation Details**

*   **Shopify API Client (`ShopifyAPIClient`):**
    *   The `ShopifyAPIClient` class is responsible for handling communication with the Shopify API. It encapsulates the session initialization, authentication, and API request logic.
    *   The client uses API pagination to ensure that all products are fetched from the store, regardless of the number of products.
    *   The `get_all_products` function retrieves all products from the Shopify store, handling API pagination to ensure all products are fetched.
    *   The `get_product_details` function fetches detailed information for a single product.
*   **Database Schema:**
    *   The database schema includes `stores` and `products` tables.
        *   The `stores` table stores the Shopify store details (domain, access token).
        *   The `products` table stores the product information.
    *   The schema is designed to store the relevant product attributes required for the AI-powered search functionality.
    *   Potential future enhancements: Use more complex database setup, move to a different database system, or implement an ORM.
*   **Data Transformation:**
    *   The `transform_product_data` function transforms the Shopify product data to match our internal database schema.
    *   The function handles missing fields and ensures that the data is in the correct format for storage.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Error handling and logging are implemented throughout the synchronization process to ensure that errors are caught, logged, and handled gracefully.
    *   The logging configuration includes a rotating file handler for persistent logs.

**Potential Areas of Complexity/Risk**

*   **Shopify API Rate Limiting:**
    *   The `ShopifyAPIClient` needs to handle Shopify API rate limits to avoid being throttled. Implement retry mechanisms and exponential backoff to handle rate limit errors.
*   **Data Consistency:**
    *   Ensure data consistency between the Shopify store and our database. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms to handle synchronization failures.
*   **Large Product Catalogs:**
    *   The initial sync process may take a long time for stores with large product catalogs. Consider implementing background tasks and optimizing the synchronization process for performance.
*   **Webhook Reliability:**
    *   In a future update, a webhook will be used to get product data. Ensure the webhook is resilient.
    *   In a future update, implement retries and error handling mechanisms for webhook processing failures.

**Debugging Tips**

*   Check the logs for any errors or warnings during the synchronization process.
*   Verify the database schema and data types to ensure they match the Shopify product attributes.
*   Use the Shopify API Explorer to test the API requests and responses.
*   Use the test suite for validation of new changes.
